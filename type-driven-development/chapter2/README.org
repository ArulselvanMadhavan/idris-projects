* Chapter 2 - Getting started with Idris

** Difference between Idris and Haskell
   - Idris is not lazily evaluated
   - String is a primitive type, unlike haskell in which String is a list of characters.
   - Idris has a function called ~repl~ that repeatedly displays a prompt, 
     reads a String from console and displays result of running a function on that string.
** Types
   - ~Int~ - Fixed width signed integer type
   - ~Integer~ - Unbounded signed integer type
   - ~Nat~ - Unbounded unsigned integer type
   - ~Double~ - Double precision floating point type
** Type conversions
   - ~the~ expressions are ordinary functions that takes advantage of first-class types.
   - ~cast~ converts from one type to another
** Documentation
   - Single line comments ~--~
   - Multi line comments ~{-~ to ~-}~
