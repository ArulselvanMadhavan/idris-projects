* Writing programs with State
  - ~State~ type can be used in functions that need to maintain a
    local mutable state.
  - Disadvantages with manually maintaining state
    1. error-prone
    2. hard to read
  - State from ~Control.Monad.State~
    #+BEGIN_SRC idris
    ||| State represented using stateType and Result type using ty.
    State : (stateType : Type) -> (ty : Type) -> Type
    ||| Runs a sequence of stateful operations, producing a pair of result and final state.
    runState : State stateType a -> stateType -> (a, stateType)

    get : State stateType stateType

    put : stateType -> State stateType ()

    (>>=) : State stateType a -> (a -> State stateType b) -> State stateType b
    #+END_SRC
  - Variants of ~runState~
    #+BEGIN_SRC idris
    |||Runs a sequence of operations and returns only the result
    evalState : State stateType a -> stateType -> a
    |||Runs a sequence of operations and returns only the final state
    execState : State stateType a -> stateType -> stateType
    #+END_SRC
