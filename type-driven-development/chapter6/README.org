* Programming with first-class types
** Type-level functions
   - Type Synonyms - To give more meaningful names names to composite types.
   - To allow a function's type to vary according to some contextual information.
   - Functions intended to compute types, start with a capital letter.
   - Type-level functions
     - Only exist at compile time. There's no runtime representation
       of ~Type~. There's no runtime representation of Type, and no
       way to inspect a Type directly.
     - Only ~total~ functions are evaluated at the type level. Why? A
       function that is not total may not cover all possible inputs and
       may not terminate.
     - Functions that are not total are treated as constants at the type-level.
