* User Defined Data types
** Classifications
   - Enumerated types - Types defined by giving the possible values directly.
   - Union types - Enum types that carry additional data with each value
   - Recursive types - Union types that are defined in terms of themselves
   - Generic types - Types that are parameterized over some other types
   - Dependent types - Types that are computed from some other value
** Notes   
   - ~%name~ - to make Idris use custom names when generating cases
** Dependent data types
   - Dependent data type is a type that's computed from some other value.
   - Types can be computed from expressions.
   - DT allow you to give more precise information about the data
     constructors of a type, by adding more arguments to the type
     constructor.
** Parameters and Indices
   - ~Vect~ is indexed by its length and parameterized by an element
     type.
   - A ~parameter~ is unchanged across the entire structure.
   - An ~index~ may change across a structure.
