* User Defined Data types
** Classifications
   - Enumerated types - Types defined by giving the possible values directly.
   - Union types - Enum types that carry additional data with each value
   - Recursive types - Union types that are defined in terms of themselves
   - Generic types - Types that are parameterized over some other types
   - Dependent types - Types that are computed from some other value
** Notes   
   - ~%name~ - to make Idris use custom names when generating cases
