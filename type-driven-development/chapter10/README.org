* Views - Extending Pattern Matching
  - Extend the forms of patterns you can use by defining informative data types called ~Views~.
  - Views are dependent types parameterized by the data you'd like to match.
  - Views give you new ways for observing data.
  - Examples:
    - Pattern match against last element of a list rather than the first.
    - Define alternative ways of traversing data structures, such as
      traversing a list in reverse or by repeatedly splitting the list
      into halves.
    - Hide complex data representations behind an abstract interface
      while still supporting pattern matching on that data.
  - ~Covering Function~ of a view describes how to convert a value
    into a view of that value.
* /with/ blocks: Syntax for extended pattern matching
  - Dependent pattern matching is common programming idiom in Idris.
  - /with/ is a construct for expressing extended pattern matching
    more concisely.
* Difference between /with/ and /case/
  - Both /with/ and /case/ allows pattern matching on intermediate results.
  - /with/ introduces a new pattern to match on the left side of a
    definition.
  - As a result, you can use pattern matching directly.
  - /with/ is used to dictate the form the input must take.
  - /with/ can produce inputs patters only if the expression passed to
    it meets the following conditions.
    - The pattern(view) passed to /with/ consists of a data constructor
      applied to some arguments of the input.
    - The argument(to view) must also be valid pattern.
    - The value of the input pattern is forced by some other valid
      /view/ pattern
* Totality Checking
  - How it works?
    - There must be patterns for all possible well-typed inputs.
    - When there is a recursive call, there must be a decreasing
      argument that converges towards a base case.
  - How it determines which arguments are decreasing?
    - Looks at the patterns for the inputs in a definition.
    - If a pattern is in the form of a data constructor, Idris
      considers the arguments in that pattern to be smaller than the input.
    - Pattern matching on views like ~xs ++ [x]~ doesn't use data
      constructors, so Idris can't determine whether the inputs
      decrease in each recursive call.
    - /Recursive views/ can help avoid this problem
* Recursive views: termination and efficiency
  - A function with a view needs 3 components
    - Original input data
    - /view/ of the input data
    - /coveringFunction/
  - Why Recursive views?
    - Views result in functions that are not ~total~
    - Views can lead to inefficient computation like reverse a list
* Nested With Blocks
  - For matching several inputs at once.
