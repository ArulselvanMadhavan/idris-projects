* Predicates: Expressing Assumptions and contracts in types
  - /Predicates/ are data types used entirely for describing
   relationships between data (i.e) property of data.
  - By expressing relationships between data in types, you can be
    explicit about the assumptions you're making about the inputs to a function.
  - These are called /compile time contracts/
** Membership tests: Elem predicate
   - ~=~, ~Void~, ~Dec~ - typically used for building properties of data.
*** Removing an element from a Vect
    #+BEGIN_SRC idris
    data Elem : a -> Vect k a -> Type where
         Here : Elem x (x :: xs)
         There : (later : Elem x xs) -> Elem x (y :: xs)
    #+END_SRC
    - If a type has no values, like ~2 + 2 = 5~, you can provide an
      implementation of the /Uninhabited/ interface.
      #+BEGIN_SRC idris
      interface Uninhabited t where
        uninhabited : t -> Void
      #+END_SRC
    - ~absurd~ is a method in ~Prelude~ that acts like a helper to
      ~uninhabited~
      #+BEGIN_SRC idris
      absurd : Uninhabited t => (h : t) -> a
      absurd h = void (uninhabited h)
      #+END_SRC
*** auto-implicit arguments: automatically constructing proofs
    - Idris uses the same expressin logic to fill ~auto~ implicit arguments.
*** Decidable predicates: deciding membership of a vector
    - ~Elem value xs~ is a decidable property for specific values of
      ~value~ and ~xs~. So, Elem is a decidable predicate.
      #+BEGIN_SRC idris
      isElem : DecEq ty => (value : ty) -> (xs : Vect n ty) -> Dec (Elem value xs)
      #+END_SRC
*** Expressing program state in types: a guessing game
    - The need for predicates like ~Elem~, ~removeElem~ arises
      naturally when we write functions that express characteristics
      of system state, such as vector length, in their types.
*** Summary
    - Write types to express assumptions about how values relate.
    - ~Elem~ dependent type is a predicate that expresses that a value
      must be contained in a vector.
    - Passing predicate as argument to a function expresses a contract
      that the inputs to the function must follow.
    - Write functions to show that a predicate is decidable - ~Dec~
    - Idris will attempt to find values for arguments marked as ~auto~
    - Capture properties of a system's state (such as rules of a game)
      in a type.
    - Predicates describe the validity of user input and ensure that
      the user input is validated when necessary.
