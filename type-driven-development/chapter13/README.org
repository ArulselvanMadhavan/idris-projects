* State Machines: Verifying protocols in types
  - Storing the abstract information in types is useful when you have
    concrete data that relates to that abstract data.
  - Data types can model state machines by using each data constructor
    to describe a state transition.
  - Describe how a Command changes the state of a system by giving the
    input and output states of the system as part of the command's type.
  - Types can model infinite state spaces as well as finite states.
  - Sequences of commands give verified sequences of state transitions
  - Represent mutable dependent typed state by putting arguments to
    dependent type in state transitions
