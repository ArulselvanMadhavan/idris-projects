* Dependent State Machines: handling feedback and errors
  - By defining valid state transitions in the type, you can be sure
    that a program that typechecks is guaranteed to describe a valid
    sequence of state transitions.
  - State transitions can also fail.
  - How to encode this in types?
    - Allow the state transition to depend on the result of an
      /operation/
      #+BEGIN_SRC idris
      -- ty is the result of the operation that could fail.
      data SomeCmd : (ty : Type) -> InputState -> (ty -> OutputState)
      #+END_SRC
    -
