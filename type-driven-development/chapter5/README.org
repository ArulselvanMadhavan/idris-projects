* Interactive Programs: Input and Output Processing
** Totality and interactive programs
   - Totality checking is based on evaluation, not execution.
   - Result of totality checking an IO program, tells you whether
     Idris will produce a finite sequence of actions, but nothing
     about the runtime behavior of those actions.
   - Interactive programs that loop forever(expecting some kind of
     user input to terminate) are not total
   - Total programs must either terminate or be guaranteed to produce
     a finite prefix of some infinite input, within finite time.
